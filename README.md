Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a custom logistic regression machine learning model. The model is built from scratch without relying on libraries like LogisticRegressor in sklearn, ensuring a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and greater control over the model's performance.

Key Features
Custom implementation of logistic regression algorithm.
Feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
Rigorous testing and evaluation processes.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [mention the source if applicable]. It contains [number of instances] instances with [number of features] features, including [list key features].

Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]
