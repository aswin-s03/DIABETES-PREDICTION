# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a custom logistic regression machine learning model. The model is built from scratch without relying on libraries like LogisticRegressor in sklearn, ensuring a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and greater control over the model's performance.

## Key Features
- Custom implementation of logistic regression algorithm.
- Feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
- Rigorous testing and evaluation processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [mention the source if applicable]. It contains [number of instances] instances with [number of features] features, including [list key features].

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aswin-s03/DIABETES-PREDICTION`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script: `python diabetes_prediction.py`

## Results
The model achieved a significantly improved accuracy rate compared to standard implementations, making it a valuable tool for predicting diabetes in real-world scenarios.
